# Basic:
"""
1. A company decided to give bonus of 5% to employee if his/her year of service is more than 5 years.
Ask user for their salary and year of service and print the net bonus amount.

2. Take values of length and breadth of a rectangle from user and check if it is square or not.

3. Take two numbers from user and print greatest among them.

4. A shop will give discount of 10% if the cost of purchased quantity is more than 1000.
Ask user for quantity
Suppose, one unit will cost 100.
Judge and print total cost for user.

5. A school has following rules for grading system:
a. Below 25 - F
b. 25 to 45 - E
c. 45 to 50 - D
d. 50 to 60 - C
e. 60 to 80 - B
f. Above 80 - A
Ask user to enter marks and print the corresponding grade.

6. Take input of age of 3 people by user and determine oldest and youngest among them.

7. Write a program to print absolute vlaue of a number entered by user. E.g.-
INPUT: 15       OUTPUT: 15
INPUT: -13      OUTPUT: 13

8.
    a) A student will not be allowed to sit in exam if his/her attendence is less than 75%.
    Take following input from user
    Number of classes held
    Number of classes attended.
    And print
    percentage of class attended
    Is student is allowed to sit in exam or not.

    B) Modify the above question to allow student to sit if he/she has medical cause. Ask user if he/she has medical cause or not ( 'Y' or 'N' ) and print accordingly. 

9. Make a Python program that counts the number of digits in the number entered by user
"""
# Advance
"""
1. Make a list containing of only strings. Now ask user for any string and re-arrange the list in the decending order of occurance of that string.

for example:
list1 = ['no bun', 'bug bun bug bun bug bug', 'bunny bug', 'buggy bug bug buggy']
input string = 'bug'
output list = ['bug bun bug bun bug bug', 'buggy bug bug buggy', 'bunny bug', 'no bun']

2. Create a Python program to generate user-defined set. Then ask user to eneter any value & check if the given value is present in a set or not.

3. Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in a list. Now, copy all the elements in another list but in reverse order.

4. Use dictionary to store antonyms of words. E.g.- 'Right':'Left', 'Up':'Down', etc. Display all words and then ask user to enter a word and display antonym of it.
5. Ask user to give name and marks of 10 different students. Store them in dictionary.
6. Sort the above dictionary by the names of students.
7. Sort the dictionary in 2 by the marks.
8. Write a Python program to split a given dictionary of lists into list of dictionaries.
Original dictionary of lists:
{'Science': [88, 89, 62, 95], 'Language': [77, 78, 84, 80]}
Split said dictionary of lists into list of dictionaries:
[{'Science': 88, 'Language': 77}, {'Science': 89, 'Language': 78}, {'Science': 62, 'Language': 84}, {'Science': 95, 'Language': 80}]

9. Make a Python program to count letters of the word: MISSISSIPPI. Your program should store them in a dictionary as: {"M":1, "I":4, "S":4, "P":2}. Next, generalize this program for any word entered by user.
